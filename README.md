# Salary-detector
An algorithm to detect salaries based on customer's transactional data. Optimised for speed by enabling multicore processing.
This is particularly useful in the financial sector where customers use their checking (salary accounts) for other transactions. Thus making it harder for financial service providers to offer curated offering based on accurate earnings of the customers.
The output contains:
- If the customer is a pension recipient
- The total credit inflows received
- The salary range of the customer and the frequency of that inflow
- If a salary has been recieved in most recent month

The majority of the work is in the helper function which has been properly documented to explain the role each function plays in the solution
